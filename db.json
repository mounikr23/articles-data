            "description": "More people than ever are using mobile messaging apps. It’s become the preferred means of communication with the total number of messages sent predicted to have taken over email by the summer of 2016. With consumers engaging with so many businesses online via chatbots to find or complete their purchases, it’s no wonder that we’re going to see a rise in what Chris Messina, the Developer Experience Lead at Uber calls ‘Conversational Commerce’. A great article.",

            "description": "There’s the happy path and then there’s the unhappy path — and that’s the one arises when you interrogate your flow to find where user’s might stray-unintentionally or otherwise-from your idealised flow. This article by Vince Speelman breaks down the lifecycle of the states to look out for. And all too important if you’re designing for the checkout flow as it could be the difference between a completed or uncompleted purchase and with the latter, a frustrated customer.",
